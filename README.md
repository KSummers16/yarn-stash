For our front-side capstone, we were encouraged to solve a problem with our application. I decided to mix my coding work with my side passion, crocheting. The problem I fixed was that yarn users canâ€™t always remember what yarn they have at home. The color, weight, brand, color family, and if they have enough for their next project. With Yarn-Stash they can have a database of what yarn they have at home and add, edit, or remove objects as their stash levels change.
